        (1) pid  %d
        The process ID.

        (2) comm  %s
        The filename of the executable, in parentheses.

        swapped out.

        (3) state  %c
        One of the following characters, indicating process
        state:

        R Running
        S  Sleeping in an interruptible wait
        D  Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep

        W  Waking (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)

        (6) session  %d
        The session ID of the process.

        (7) tty_nr  %d
        The controlling terminal of the process.  (The minor
        device number is contained in the combination of
        bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is
        in bits 15 to 8.)

        (8) tpgid  %d
        The ID of the foreground process group of the
        controlling terminal of the process.

        (9) flags  %u
        The kernel flags word of the process.  For bit
        meanings, see the PF_* defines in the Linux kernel
        source file include/linux/sched.h.  Details depend
        on the kernel version.

        The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

        (10) minflt  %lu
        The number of minor faults the process has made
        which have not required loading a memory page from
        disk.

        (11) cminflt  %lu
        The number of minor faults that the process's
        waited-for children have made.

        (12) majflt  %lu
        The number of major faults the process has made
        which have required loading a memory page from disk.

        (13) cmajflt  %lu
        The number of major faults that the process's
        waited-for children have made.

        (14) utime  %lu
        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
        in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time,
                guest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                        below), so that applications that are not aware of
        the guest time field do not lose that time from
        their calculations.

        (15) stime  %lu
        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
        in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by ysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

        (16) cutime  %ld
        Amount of time that this process's waited-for
        children have been scheduled in user mode, measured
        in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
        (See also times(2).)  This includes guest time,
        cguest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see  below).

        (17) cstime  %ld
        Amount of time that this process's waited-for
        children have been scheduled in kernel mode,
        measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

        (18) priority  %ld
        (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a
        real-time scheduling policy (policy below; see
        sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated
        scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a number in
        the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time
        priorities 1 to 99.  For processes running under a
        non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw
        nice value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the
        kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers in
        the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the
        user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

        Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
        the scheduler weighting given to this process.

        (19) nice  %ld
        The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in the
        range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

        (20) num_threads  %ld
        Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).
        Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as
        a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

        (21) itrealvalue  %ld
        The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent
        to the process due to an interval timer.Since
        kernel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained,  and is hard coded as 0.

        (22) starttime  %llu
        The time the process started after system boot.  In
        kernels before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed
        in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed
        in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
        The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

        (23) vsize  %lu
        Virtual memory size in bytes.

        (24) rss  %ld
        Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has
        in real memory.  This is just the pages which count
        toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not
        include pages which have not been demand-loaded in,  or which are swapped out.

        (25) rsslim  %lu
        Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the
        process; see the description of RLIMIT_RSS in getrlimit(2).

        (26) startcode  %lu  [PT]
        The address above which program text can run.

        (27) endcode  %lu  [PT]
        The address below which program text can run.

        (28) startstack  %lu  [PT]
        The address of the start (i.e., bottom) of the
        stack.

        (29) kstkesp  %lu  [PT]
        The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as found
        in the kernel stack page for the process.

        (30) kstkeip  %lu  [PT]
        The current EIP (instruction pointer).

        (31) signal  %lu
        The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a
        decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
        provide information on real-time signals; use   /proc/[pid]/status instead.

        (32) blocked  %lu
        The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a
        decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
        provide information on real-time signals; use  /proc/[pid]/status instead.

        (33) sigignore  %lu
        The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a
        decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
        provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.

        (34) sigcatch  %lu
        The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a decimal
        number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide
        information on real-time signals; use  /proc/[pid]/status instead.

        (35) wchan  %lu  [PT]
        This is the "channel" in which the process is
        waiting.  It is the address of a location in the
        kernel where the process is sleeping.  The
        corresponding symbolic name can be found in /proc/[pid]/wchan.

        (36) nswap  %lu
        Number of pages swapped (not maintained).

        (37) cnswap  %lu
        Cumulative nswap for child processes (not  maintained).

        (38) exit_signal  %d  (since Linux 2.1.22)
        Signal to be sent to parent when we die.

        (39) processor  %d  (since Linux 2.2.8)
        CPU number last executed on.

        (40) rt_priority  %u  (since Linux 2.5.19)
        Real-time scheduling priority, a number in the range
        1 to 99 for processes scheduled under a real-time
        policy, or 0, for non-real-time processes (see  sched_setscheduler(2)).

        (41) policy  %u  (since Linux 2.5.19)
        Scheduling policy (see sched_setscheduler(2)).
        Decode using the SCHED_* constants in linux/sched.h.

        (42) delayacct_blkio_ticks  %llu  (since Linux 2.6.18)
        Aggregated block I/O delays, measured in clock ticks (centiseconds).

        (43) guest_time  %lu  (since Linux 2.6.24)
        Guest time of the process (time spent running a
        virtual CPU for a guest operating system), measured
        in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

        (44) cguest_time  %ld  (since Linux 2.6.24)
        Guest time of the process's children, measured in
        clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

        (45) start_data  %lu  (since Linux 3.3)  [PT]
        Address above which program initialized and
        uninitialized (BSS) data are placed.

        (46) end_data  %lu  (since Linux 3.3)  [PT]
        Address below which program initialized and
        uninitialized (BSS) data are placed.
